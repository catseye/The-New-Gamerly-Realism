The New Gamerly Realism
=======================

BACKSTORY
---------

Only when the conscious habit of coding culture's little interactions,
Marios and Lara Crofts in games disappears
_will we witness a purely gamerly work of gamedev_.

I have transformed myself _in the zero of gameplay_ and have fished myself out
of the _rubbishy slough of mainstream gaming_.

I have destroyed the ring of level design and got out of the circle of
powerups, the level design ring that has imprisoned the gamedev and the
interactions of culture.  This accursed ring, by revealing novelty after
novelty, leads the gamedev away from the _aim of reification_.

And only _cowardly consciousness_ and insolvency of creative power in a gamedev
yield to this deception and establish
_their game on the interactions of culture_,
afraid of losing the foundation on which the _retrodev_ and the _mainstream_
have based their gaming.

To produce favourite powerups and little interactions of culture is just like
a thief being enraptured with their own shackled legs.

Only dull and impotent gamedevs veil their work with _sincerity_.
Gaming requires _truth_, not _sincerity_.

_Levels have vanished like smoke; to attain the new gamerly paradigm_,
gamedev advances towards creation as an end in itself and towards
reification of the interactions of culture.

INSTRUCTIONS
------------

Use the arrow keys to guide the protagonist (represented by a black square)
around the playfield (represented by a black square) to collect all the
treasures (represented by black squares) while avoiding the pits (represented
by black squares.)  Each treasure collected earns the player 10 points; the
score is shown in the upper-left (in black).  The player begins the game with
three lives; succumbing to a pit costs a life; the number of lives is
displayed in the lower-left (in black).  When the game is over, left-click
the canvas to start a new game.

FINAL NOTE
----------

Detractors and other peasants may satisfy themselves that this is actually a
game and not just an entirely black gif or something by opening the game's
`iframe` in a new tab, opening up their Javascript console there, and
changing the variable BACKGROUND_COLOR.
